EVA login animation( in the system tray ) uses QMovie, which only support MNG and GIF.
Because of the patent problem of format GIF, TrollTech recommend using MNG, and also developers are warned in Qt docs that the support of GIF MAY BE REMOVED some time.

You can create simple MNG animation( like the login one ) after following steps:
1. Create series of pics, better in PNG format.
2. Use 'convert', which is in imagemagick package.
    # convert -delay n PNGs target.mng
   which 'n' is a number means 1/100 seconds.
3. You got it!
